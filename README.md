## Tips and Tricks

* You'll need an amplifier to get much sound out (especially if demonstrating to an entire classroom). I used the [LP-2020A+](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LP-2020A%2B)
* Watch out for abuse of hot glue
* If their lid is attached, they'll need to cut it off
* If the c clamps rattle, you can use some hot glue on them
* Make sure they leave plenty of extra wire on both ends of the coil
* I've used AWG 26 & AWG 13, and prefer 13 as it doesn't heat up after short use
* The speakers make pretty fantastic headphones - just need a little soldering + a coat hanger
