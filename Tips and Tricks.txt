You'll need an amplifier to get much sound out. I used the LP-2020A+ (http://amzn.com/B0049P6OTI)
Watch out for abuse of hot glue
If their lid is attached, they'll need to cut it off
If the c clamps rattle, you can use some hot glue on them
Make sure they leave plenty of extra wire on both ends of the coil
I've used AWG 26 & AWG 13, and prefer 13 as it doesn't heat up after short use
The speakers make pretty fantastic headphones - just need a little soldering + a coat hanger
